NEW:
- Switched music from OGG to MOD files, which are lighter and require less CPU usage, which means better performance! Thanks @mills32 for this contribution!
- Improved renderer for PSP, getting 60fps most of the time! Thanks @mills32 for this contribution!
- Thanks to the new renderer, audio quality in PSP has been also bumped.
- Switched sound effects from OGG to WAV. They require less CPU usage, which is another increase in performance and simpler packaging!
- Now there is only one build for both Old and New Nintendo 3DS.

FIXED:
- Switch: Virtual keyboard wouldn't work when the game is running in Applet mode. Instead, now it will just autogenerate a player name. Thanks @rjimenezda for this fix!
