NEW:
- Switched music from OGG to MOD files, which are lighter and require less CPU usage, which means better performance! Thanks @mills32 for this contribution!

FIXED:
- Switch: Virtual keyboard wouldn't work when the game is running in Applet mode. Instead, now it will just autogenerate a player name. Thanks @rjimenezda for this fix!
